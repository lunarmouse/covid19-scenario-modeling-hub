methods: Because of the complexity of socio-epidemiological system of COVID-19, we developed a data-driven, non-mechanistic statistical model to track and characterize and predict the cumulative case in 2025, assuming it follow certain asymptotic curves. In round #19 we choose a hybrid method with weighted average of both shorter and longer fitting period in order to capture both short-term and long-term dynamics of COVID-19. We projected both hospitalization and death based on the 2023-2025 data as the baseline scenario (no external processes such as changes in NPIs, vaccination campaigns including booster shots, new variants,, etc.) at weekly temporal resolution. We considered several different temporal forces: annually, biannually, and quarterly, as well as weekly fluctuations. Other important driving factors, such as immune evasiveness and vaccination, were modeled as their respective time-varying parameters on incidence, hospitalizaiton, and death rates in each state.

contact_tracing: NA
testing: NA
vaccine_efficacy_transmission: Efficacy of vaccine to reduce symptoms was modeled as scenario guideline.
vaccine_efficacy_delay: NA
vaccine_hesitancy: Vaccine hesitancy was implicitly modeled as an asympototic curve of vaccination rate in each state.
vaccine_immunity_duration: 4-6 months, exponential decay. 
natural_immunity_duration: same as vaccine-induced immunity.
case_fatality_rate: CFR was estimated as a time-varying function (implicitly with vaccination rate) in each state from reported death and case data in 2022-2023.
infection_fatality_rate: NA
asymptomatics: NA
age_groups: All age groups, <65 and 65+ 
importations: NA for current version.
confidence_interval_method: Several assumptions were made to address uncertainty, e.g., system stochasticity from random noise, state-level variation in vaccination rate, yearly variability, etc.
calibration: 2023-2025  hospitalization, and death data by state were used to model and calibrate the initial model. 
spatial_structure: By state.
data_inputs: prescribed by the SMH coordination team.
